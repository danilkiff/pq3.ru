title: Decision routing
summary: Every decision has a cost. Routing it correctly -- upward for alignment, downward for speed -- is essential to system resilience.

## Escalation vs empowerment: the decision routing dilemma

Every decision needs a route -- either upward for coordination or downward for execution. Misrouting leads to delay, drift, or disengagement. Good routing supports both system alignment and team autonomy.

## Why routing matters

Routing errors have predictable consequences:

- **Over-escalation**: creates delay, central bottlenecks, and disempowered teams  
- **Under-escalation**: leads to local optimization, misaligned priorities, and strategic drift

Both weaken resilience by introducing hidden friction.

## Classifying decisions for routing

Use these filters:

- **Reversibility**  
  - Easy to reverse → empower  
  - Hard to reverse → escalate or review

- **Scope of impact**  
  - Local scope → empower  
  - Cross-domain or systemic scope → escalate

- **Clarity of success**  
  - Clear metrics and value → empower  
  - Ambiguous goals or conflict → escalate for framing

## Empowering without chaos

- Use lightweight decision templates to guide reasoning  
- Define boundary agreements to clarify where autonomy ends  
- Review decisions for learning, not blame, to build adaptive trust

## Metrics for healthy decision routing

- **High edge decision velocity**: local teams can act  
- **Low critical escalation volume**: ownership is working  
- **High learning density**: decisions are producing insight, not just output
