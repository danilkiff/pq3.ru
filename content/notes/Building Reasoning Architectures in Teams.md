title: Reasoning architecture
summary: Scaling teams requires explicit reasoning structures. Without them, decision quality degrades as context and clarity erode.

## Building reasoning architectures in teams

As teams grow, unstructured thinking becomes costly. Good decisions do not scale by default. A reasoning architecture provides the scaffolding for shared, traceable, and adaptive thinking.

## What is a reasoning architecture

A reasoning architecture defines how a team:

- frames decisions  
- weighs trade-offs  
- challenges assumptions  
- preserves and evolves context

Without deliberate design, reasoning defaults to local habits. This often hides risk and increases cognitive overhead.

## Building blocks

- **Decision records**: ADRs and TDRs that keep logic visible  
- **Trade-off summaries**: documents that show what was sacrificed and why  
- **Context maps**: track how core assumptions shift  
- **Reasoning retrospectives**: structured reviews of how the team thinks, not just what it ships

## Structuring reasoning

- Use lightweight artifacts embedded in daily tools  
- Focus on exposing risk before forcing consensus  
- Treat context as versioned, not fixed  
- Make reasoning design an explicit part of team operations

In stable teams, reasoning is part of shared infrastructure. It is not ad hoc, hidden, or informal.

## Anti-patterns

- **Authority-based reasoning**: fragile when leadership rotates  
- **Rationalization overload**: endless analysis delays action  
- **Context loss**: decisions are repeated because rationale is missing

These failures emerge by default if no architecture exists.
