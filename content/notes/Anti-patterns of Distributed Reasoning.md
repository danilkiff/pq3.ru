title: Distributed reasoning
summary: Distributed reasoning systems amplify both learning and dysfunction. Without protection, drift and decay dominate.

## Context

Distributed reasoning often promises scale, but delivers confusion. Enabling thinking across teams requires protecting it from the failure modes that appear in every collective system.

## Core anti-patterns of distributed reasoning

1. **Fragmented context propagation**  
Teams operate with conflicting assumptions. This leads to constant realignment, contradictory designs, and repeated mistakes.

2. **Premature convergence**  
Decisions are made too quickly. Alternatives go unexplored. This produces rigid systems and suppresses dissent.

3. **Hidden ownership of reasoning**  
Decision paths lack visibility. Teams cannot trace who made a choice or why it was made.

4. **Blame-driven postmortems**  
Learning halts under pressure to assign fault. Fixes remain superficial. Root causes go untouched.

5. **Overformalization of reasoning**  
Documents are completed, but thinking degrades. Artifacts exist, but insight is missing.

Distributed reasoning magnifies both learning and dysfunction. Which one dominates depends on the surrounding culture.

## Defensive practices

To counter these failures:

- Use lightweight context maps to keep teams aligned.  
- Apply structured divergence to surface competing options.  
- Track decisions with short, visible records (such as TLDRs or ADRs).  
- Run incident reviews that focus on systems, not blame.  
- Keep reasoning alive through conversation and iteration, not form templates.

## Silent drift

Some of the most severe failures occur without noise. Drift is quiet.

- Context evolves, but shared understanding lags.  
- Mental models slowly diverge.  
- Teams appear aligned while reasoning degrades.

Early detection requires more than delivery metrics. It demands **reasoning retrospectives**  --  routine checks on how teams think, not just what they build.
