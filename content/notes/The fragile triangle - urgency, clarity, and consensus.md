title: Urgency, clarity, consensus
summary: Every high-stakes decision in engineering lives inside a tension triangle. You need at least two sides strong. You rarely get all three.

## The triangle

Every pressured technical decision rests on three forces:

- **Urgency** → Drives motion
- **Clarity** → Defines success
- **Consensus** → Aligns execution

You rarely get all three. If you try, you stall.

## Common failure modes

| Missing     | Consequence                    |
|-------------|--------------------------------|
| Urgency     | Drift, missed windows          |
| Clarity     | Rework, incoherent results     |
| Consensus   | Silent resistance, rollback    |

## Tension by design

Each vertex resists the others:

- **Urgency → clarity loss**
- **Clarity → urgency delay**
- **Consensus → both clarity and urgency under pressure**

Don’t eliminate the tension. Navigate it.

## Tactics

- **Declare trade-offs.**  
  → “We’ll sacrifice consensus. Clarity and urgency are fixed.”

- **Set ‘enough clarity’ thresholds.**  
  → Define what must be known now. Postpone the rest.

- **Pre-wire tie-breaks.**  
  → Agree in advance who decides when consensus fails.

- **Timebox alignment.**  
  → “We align what we can in 48h. Then we move.”

## Operational signals

| Metric             | Meaning                        |
|--------------------|--------------------------------|
| Decision latency   | Urgency drag                   |
| Rework rate        | Clarity too low                |
| Alignment decay    | Consensus was never real       |

## Trail

Emergent from:

- postmortems with surprise dissent  
- decision hygiene lapses under time stress  
- stalled initiatives where “clarity” kept expanding

## Bottom line

Every decision lives in the triangle.
You **choose where to bend**, and make that bend explicit.
