title: Organizational trust
summary: Trust is built by how teams behave -- not just by uptime. Promises, consistency, and visible learning form the foundation.

## Organizational trustworthiness: beyond SLA and uptime

Reliability metrics are not enough. Trust is built by the behavior of people and teams -- what they promise, how they respond, and how they learn. Building trustworthy systems requires building trustworthy organizations.

## What organizational trust looks like

| Dimension      | Technical Reflection        | Organizational Reflection               |
| -------------- | --------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Predictability | Stable system behavior      | Consistent team actions and leadership   |
| Transparency   | Observable system state     | Open communication and decision process  |
| Recoverability | Fast failure recovery       | Continuous learning and adjustment       |

## Why SLA and uptime are not enough

Strong metrics can mask weak behavior:

- delivery depends on heroics  
- assumptions drift silently  
- weak retros fail to close learning loops

Trust is not just the absence of failure -- it’s the presence of integrity and alignment.

## Engineering organizational trust

- **Clear promises and boundaries**  
  Avoid vague goals. Make uncertainties explicit.

- **Consistency under stress**  
  Teams behave the same under pressure as they do in calm.

- **Systematic learning from variance**  
  Track gaps between plan and reality. Encourage early signals from the edge.

- **Distributed responsibility, centralized integrity**  
  Local autonomy, but with a shared commitment to system-wide coherence

Trust is not a status -- it’s a cycle.

## Example organizational metrics

| Metric                                       | Signal                                  |
| ------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| % of initiatives with success criteria      | Clarity of goals                        |
| Time from drift detection to correction     | Transparency and responsiveness         |
| Post-incident improvement adoption rate     | Strength of learning systems            |
