title: Prompt AGI properly
summary: Use AGI as cognitive infrastructure, not automation. State goals, define roles, ask for reasoning, and never offload judgment.

## What

This document outlines the principles for responsible, high-integrity use of advanced AI systems. It replaces prompt hacks with prompt literacy -- and positions the user as an intentional agent, not a passive consumer.

## Why

Prompting AGI is not a mechanical act. It is a form of augmented reasoning. Done poorly, it becomes:

- **dishonest**: masking knowledge gaps instead of exposing them  
- **irresponsible**: shifting judgment to systems you don’t understand  
- **dangerous**: scaling unverified claims under the guise of intelligence

Power without understanding is not augmentation -- it is automation without ethics.

## How

### State your objective

AGI systems do not infer intent. Name your goal, context, and intended use.

- **Bad**: “Write a report on AGI”  
- **Good**: “As a systems architect designing a cognitive substrate, I need a comparative review of reflective AGI architectures for maintainability and interpretability.”

### Set the model’s role

Define the stance the model should take -- teacher, reviewer, co-designer.

- “Act as a cognitive scientist reviewing epistemic resilience in AGI design.”

### Provide structure

Unstructured prompts produce unstructured results. Set expectations.

- Use markdown. Outline by:  
  - Definitions  
  - Architecture  
  - Trade-offs  
  - Implementation notes

### Ask for trade-offs, not just answers

Truth emerges from tension. Ask:

- What are the trade-offs?  
- What are the known failure modes?  
- When does this approach break down?

### Demand reasoning

Don’t accept claims without cause.

- If a method is suggested -- ask why it works  
- If a decision is made -- ask when it fails

Interrogate the output like you would a peer.

### Respect your limits

AGI is not a shortcut to credibility.

- Don’t use it to fake knowledge  
- Don’t simulate roles beyond your comprehension  
- Use it to learn, not to pose

## Conclusion

High-level AGI interaction is a form of agency. The contract is simple:

- **Don’t use prompts you don’t understand**  
- **Don’t publish outputs you can’t defend**  
- **Don’t outsource judgment**  

You don’t operate a complex system by copying outputs. You operate it by understanding the forces you’ve invoked.
