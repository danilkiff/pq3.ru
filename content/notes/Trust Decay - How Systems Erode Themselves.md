title: Trust decay
summary: Systems fail gradually as trust erodes across code, teams, and processes. Recognizing early signs prevents invisible collapse.

## Why it matters

Systems rarely fail suddenly. They erode through small, compounding losses of trust -- between components, teams, and assumptions. This decay is subtle but cumulative. Detecting and addressing it early is key to long-term reliability.

## The mechanics of trust decay

Trust decays through predictable system behaviors:

- **Silent drift**  --  Assumptions shift unnoticed. Integrations break as formats evolve without coordination.
- **Invisible complexity**  --  Hidden dependencies accumulate. Services rely on undocumented behaviors.
- **Deferred risk**  --  Known risks are postponed without mitigation. Temporary workarounds become permanent.
- **Erosion of learning loops**  --  Reviews and postmortems lose depth. Signals become noise, rituals replace feedback.

## Symptoms of trust decay

- Increased reliance on individual effort to sustain system stability
- Confidence in delivery estimates declines
- Incidents surprise teams more often
- Routine decisions escalate due to uncertainty

## Engineering defenses against trust decay

1. **Assumption drift detection**  
   Revalidate assumptions in architecture reviews and operational audits.

2. **Complexity budgeting**  
   Track integration growth and dependency sprawl, not just service count.

3. **Risk portfolio management**  
   Treat technical risk as debt: maintain visibility, monitor exposure, design exits.

4. **Living feedback systems**  
   Keep feedback mechanisms connected to actual decisions and outcomes.

## Organizational reflections

Systemic trust decay usually mirrors organizational behavior:

- Commitments slip without recalibration
- Priorities shift silently
- Communication gaps widen over time

Trust resilience requires both system design and team culture to evolve together.

## Measuring early signals

- **Broken assumptions per quarter**  --  Track how often expectations diverge from reality.
- **Risk backlog delta**  --  Monitor accumulation of unmanaged risks over time.
- **Feedback loop depth**  --  Count how many issues lead to systemic change, not just patchwork.

## Reasoning trail

This analysis draws from resilience engineering, cognitive drift studies, and technical debt models. The framing aligns with postmortem patterns that emphasize failed assumptions and shallow feedback.

The core idea is that systems fail when they lose the ability to self-correct, not when they first break. Detecting erosion before collapse is the work of trust engineering.
