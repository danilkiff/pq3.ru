I design and operate distributed systems, targeting on reliability, architecture, and long-term organizational capability. Over the past 15+ years, Iâ€™ve worked as a systems architect, technical lead, and engineering manager in banking, telecom, and enterprise IT, leading teams through the entire product and system lifecycle -- from inception to continuous evolution.

My engineering background is rooted in hands-on software development, database optimization, and production troubleshooting. I build, break, and rebuild systems not only to achieve technical uptime, but to understand the causes behind both failure and resilience.

I believe that sustainable engineering is impossible without organizational learning, explicit knowledge transfer, and trust -- both between systems and within teams. Most "incidents" are not about bugs or hardware, but about reasoning debt, capability drift, or lost context. 

My work focuses on making these hidden factors visible, building frameworks that connect technology, process, and people.
