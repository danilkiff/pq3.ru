title: Slow to rot
summary: Trustworthy systems evolve deliberately and visibly while resisting silent decay and unacknowledged drift.

## Why it matters

Not all slowness is the same. Systems that evolve slowly by design can scale trustably. Systems that decay slowly collapse without warning. The difference lies in whether change is controlled or deferred.

## Two kinds of slow

- **Decay slowness**: Gradual erosion of system integrity. Often invisible until failure. Symptoms include accumulating exceptions, misaligned decisions, and cultural drift.
- **Evolution slowness**: Intentional pacing of change. Transparent, structured, and supported by safeguards.

Decay slowness leads to fragility. Evolution slowness builds durability.

## Risks of invisible decay

Systems appear stable while losing coherence. Typical decay signals:

- Local fixes diverging from systemic goals.
- Behavior changing without clarity or record.
- Decision history disappearing from context.

Rot begins quietly, often under the label of “speed.”

## Traits of healthy evolution

Trustworthy systems adopt change through explicit steps:

- Versioned interfaces with deprecation paths.
- Capability reviews to check alignment and readiness.
- Pre-mortems to expose likely failure paths.
- Change budgets to control exposure.

These steps keep evolution safe, reversible, and explainable.

## Common misinterpretations

- Calling frequent patches "agility" when they’re masking regressions.
- Equating deployment speed with evolution when it reflects unmanaged risk.
- Framing decay as improvement due to lack of baselines.

False signals of progress often hide architectural erosion.

## Metrics for evolution health

- **Unplanned rollback rate** reflects change stability.
- **Mean time between capability drift events** tracks long-term system alignment.
- **Percentage of changes with documented preconditions** signals operational maturity.

Monitoring these helps distinguish controlled growth from unmanaged change.

## Reasoning trail

Synthesized from legacy failure analyses, incident reviews, and infrastructure studies. Based on the idea that trust in systems emerges from their ability to change without eroding. Draws on safety-critical engineering and architectural lifecycle practices.
