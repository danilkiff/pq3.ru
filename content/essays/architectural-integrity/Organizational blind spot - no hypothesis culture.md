title: No hypothesis culture
summary: Teams that skip hypothesis validation ship untested features, accumulate cognitive debt, and erode product value and team motivation.

## Purpose

This model highlights the risks and costs of making product decisions without validating hypotheses. It serves as a reflection tool and a foundation for shifting toward discovery-first practices.

## Signals of a no-hypothesis culture

- Features are added to the roadmap without a problem statement  
- Conversations focus on deadlines, not intent  
- Delivery is seen as success -- regardless of impact  
- Failed features are ignored, not analyzed  
- Analytics are used post-facto to justify work, not to inform it

These signs reflect a culture driven by motion, not learning.

## Consequences

| Area              | Impact                                        |
|-------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| Speed             | Delivery volume increases, but relevance drops  |
| Decision quality  | Opinions override data  |
| Value delivery    | Features ship without clear evidence of impact  |
| Architecture      | Noise increases, systems grow complex and incoherent  |
| Team engagement   | Motivation declines as purpose becomes unclear  |

Lack of validation introduces cognitive debt -- decisions pile up without clarity, degrading roadmap trust and architectural coherence.

## Cultural debt

Building without testing assumes correctness by default. Over time, this creates organizational fog -- activity without evidence. It looks productive but drains alignment, purpose, and product clarity.

## Recommendations

1. **Embed lightweight discovery**  
   Use tools like Job Stories, Assumption Mapping, or Opportunity Canvases to structure early thinking.

2. **Add hypothesis states to the backlog**  
   Use explicit workflow statuses: `Hypothesis`, `Validated`, `Falsified`, `Deferred`. Make assumptions traceable.

3. **Enforce a Definition of Ready**  
   Every backlog item must include:
   - A hypothesis  
   - A clear goal  
   - A basic success metric

4. **Run postmortems on failed or unused features**  
   These postmortems surface silent drift and foster cultural learning.

## How to use

- In team retrospectives to identify process gaps  
- As part of internal product operations audits  
- To support transitions toward discovery-led product delivery

This model is a diagnostic lens for teams that move fast but struggle to confirm value. Without a hypothesis culture, speed becomes noise.
