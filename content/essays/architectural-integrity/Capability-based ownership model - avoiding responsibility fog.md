title: Capability ownership model
summary: Defining ownership by capabilities, not components, prevents responsibility gaps and improves system resilience.

## Why it matters

In complex systems, ownership defined by services or modules is not enough. What matters is not who owns the code, but who owns the capability -- the promise the system makes under stress. Without this alignment, you get responsibility fog: unclear escalation paths, fragmented resilience, and fragile operations.

## What is responsibility fog

Responsibility fog arises when:

- System behaviors lack clear owners (e.g. auth, consistency, fault recovery)
- Ownership maps to artifacts, not to outcomes
- During incidents, multiple teams defer action due to unclear boundaries

This leads to delays, duplicated effort, and system-level risk.

## From components to capabilities

Shifting ownership to capabilities means:

- **From service boundaries** to **capability boundaries**
- **From API artifacts** to **system promises**
- **From isolated debt** to **shared systemic trade-offs**

Capabilities cut across services. They define what the system must reliably do regardless of how many teams or modules are involved.

Example:

- Capability: Consistent user authentication under load  
- Spans: Identity services, session store, SDK integration  
- Ownership: One team is accountable for the capability, not just one piece of the stack

## Core design principles

1. **Capabilities first**  
   Define critical behaviors and guarantees. Then map services and teams to those.

2. **Resilience is part of ownership**  
   Owning a capability includes its error budget, fallback modes, and recovery plans -- not just its success path.

3. **Contract clarity**  
   Capabilities must define clear expectations:
   - What they need from upstream
   - What they guarantee to downstream
   - How they behave under degradation

These should be part of formal capability contracts, not just embedded in code or dashboards.

## Capability map elements

A working capability map includes:

- Capability name
- Accountable owner
- SLA and resilience thresholds
- Defined failure modes and fallback logic
- Alarm thresholds and telemetry coverage

These maps should be reviewed after major incidents and updated during system evolution.

## Outcomes

A capability-based model:

- Clarifies who responds when things break
- Aligns team incentives around system outcomes
- Improves failure containment through known degradation paths
- Exposes architectural trade-offs that affect system behavior as a whole

## Reasoning trail

This model draws from large-scale system incidents where service-based ownership failed to surface true accountability. Teams owned pieces, but no one owned the outcome. Capabilities provide a clearer boundary for resilience and coordination.

The key insight: capabilities are the real unit of ownership. Services are implementation detail.
