title: Reflection protocol
summary: Strategic delegation retains understanding and accountability; abdication occurs when decisions are outsourced without comprehension.
---

## Purpose

This protocol helps technical leaders distinguish between strategic delegation and cognitive abdication -- especially when using AI systems or expert input in decision-making.

## The core principle

Delegation is not abdication unless decisions are handed off without understanding. Shared reasoning is valid. Final accountability must stay with the human operator.

## Checklist: are you delegating strategically?

- You define the context before asking  
  → You’re framing the problem  
- You compare responses to your own hypotheses  
  → You’re engaging, not offloading  
- You request structure, not decisions  
  → You’re looking for scaffolding, not substitution  
- You revise and challenge the output  
  → You’re reasoning with it, not deferring to it  
- You record the final choice and why it was made  
  → You’re signaling ownership

These actions indicate intentional delegation with retained oversight.

## Signs of cognitive refusal

- "Just tell me what to do"  
- Lack of translation between advice and context  
- Avoiding decisions to evade risk  
- Using delegation to bypass complexity  
- Defaulting to tool output as authoritative truth

These are signals that reasoning is being avoided, not distributed.

## Reflection prompts

Use these during 1:1s or self-reviews:

- What decision am I actually making?  
- What constraints or risks have I already mapped?  
- Am I delegating due to overload, or am I avoiding ownership?  
- Do I understand the logic behind the answer?  
- If this fails, can I explain why I accepted the recommendation?

These questions surface whether you’re delegating to expand insight -- or to shield from responsibility.

## Example: working with AI systems

- **Strategic delegation:**  
  “Help me analyze trade-offs in this architecture. I want to test my assumptions.”

- **Cognitive abdication:**  
  “Write the architecture for me. I don’t want to think about it.”

Delegation should reduce load, not bypass cognition. The goal is to shift from memory-bound work to system-level thinking. This is augmentation, not substitution.
