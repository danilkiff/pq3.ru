This section gathers the core essays and long-form series of the blog -- each focused on a critical domain of engineering systems, architecture, and organizational design. These are not isolated articles, but interlinked, evolving knowledge bases built for practicing technical leaders and system architects.

The major series:

### [[essays/agi/index|AGI]]

Essays on the boundaries of artificial general intelligence, alignment, and long-term system intent.

### [[essays/architectural-integrity/index|Architectural integrity]]

Protocols, trade-offs, and anti-patterns for making system architecture robust and adaptable under real-world constraints.

### [[essays/organizational-memory/index|Organizational memory]]

Tools and patterns for building resilient, actionable memory across teams — not just documentation, but collective reasoning and learning.

### [[essays/resilient-evolution/index|Resilient evolution]]

How to engineer safe, trustworthy, and reversible change in both systems and organizations.

### [[essays/systems-under-drift/index|Systems under drift]]

Diagnosing and correcting invisible forces — alignment loss, prioritization bias, ownership erosion — that silently undermine reliability at scale.

Each series is self-contained, but the links between them are what enable mastery.  
Explore by the domain most urgent for you — or use the cross-links to follow risks, feedback loops, and learning patterns across the stack.
