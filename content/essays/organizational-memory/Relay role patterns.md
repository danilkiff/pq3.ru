title: Relay role patterns
summary: A structured handoff role that preserves context and reduces risk during incident transitions across shifts.
---

## Why it matters

During incidents, context is as critical as time. When responsibility shifts across teams or time zones, poor handoffs lead to duplicated effort, missed signals, and delays. A designated relay role stabilizes transitions by protecting operational continuity under pressure.

## Core idea

The relay is a role focused solely on context transfer. It bridges the outgoing and incoming teams without taking on resolution tasks. This living bridge reduces cognitive load and prevents context erosion during high-stress moments.

## Practical applications

- **During handoffs**
  - Relay joins the final hour of the outgoing shift.
  - Collects key incident data: timeline, symptoms, actions, current hypotheses.
  - Delivers a concise, structured briefing to the incoming team.

- **In shift design**
  - Build explicit relay windows into the rotation schedule.
  - Rotate the role to avoid fatigue and normalize responsibility.

- **For complex events**
  - Pair the relay with a shadow observer to surface latent patterns.
  - Keep the relay on passive standby post-handoff for rapid clarification.

## Common pitfalls

Without structure, relays can drift from their purpose or be ignored entirely:

- Taking on troubleshooting tasks dilutes focus -- relays should transfer, not fix.
- Ad-hoc handoffs degrade quickly -- checklists and templates enforce consistency.
- Unassigned relays create gaps -- ownership must be visible and planned.
- If the incoming team skips the relay, information loss is immediate -- relay briefings must be a required step.
