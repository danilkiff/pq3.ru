I build and operate distributed systems at scale, with a focus on reliability, architecture, and long-term organizational capability. 
For more than 15 years, I have led engineering teams and designed systems in banking, telecom, and enterprise IT -- covering the entire lifecycle from design and launch to sustained evolution.

My approach is shaped by direct experience: hands-on development, database and infrastructure optimization, and production troubleshooting under pressure. I treat system failures and recoveries as core engineering signals, not edge cases. The goal is not only uptime, but deep understanding of why systems break, adapt, and recover.

Engineering does not scale on code and tools alone. Sustainable systems depend on explicit knowledge transfer, operational transparency, and trust -- both within teams and across technical boundaries. Most outages and regressions trace back to gaps in reasoning, drift in capability, or lost organizational context -- not isolated bugs.

My work is aimed at surfacing these hidden factors. I design frameworks that connect technology, process, and people, making system health measurable and operational at every layer.
