## Context

As teams grow, the cost of fragmented reasoning compounds.

**Good decision-making doesn’t scale automatically with headcount.**  
It requires intentional design: creating *reasoning architectures* that support shared, transparent, and evolvable thinking.

---

## What is a reasoning architecture?

A **reasoning architecture** is the *meta-structure* by which:

- Decisions are framed.
- Trade-offs are surfaced.
- Assumptions are challenged.
- Context is preserved.

> **Core insight**: If you don't design how your team thinks, the environment will design it for you — usually poorly.

## Building blocks

| Component                | Purpose                                  |
|:----------------------------|:--------------------------------------|
| Decision Records (ADR, TDR) | Traceability of rationale             |
| Trade-off Documents         | Visibility into conscious sacrifices  |
| Context Maps                | Preservation of assumptions over time |
| Reasoning Retrospectives    | Evolution of thinking patterns        |

## Patterns for structuring reasoning

**Lightweight, always-accessible artifacts**  
Store decisions where engineers live: code, documentation, day-to-day tools.

**Reasoning first, consensus later**  
Focus on framing options and risks clearly before pushing for alignment.

- **Iterative context updates**  
Context is not static; it must be versioned, just like code.

- **Explicit meta-decisions**  
Periodically decide *how* you want to reason as a team, not just *what* to decide.

> **Core insight**: in healthy teams, reasoning becomes a shared infrastructure — not a hidden cost.

## Anti-patterns to watch for

| Anti-pattern                  | Hidden Cost                      |
|:------------------------------|:----------------------------------|
| Reasoning by authority        | Fragility under new leadership    |
| Overload of rationalization   | Paralysis by over-analysis        |
| Context loss in documentation | Reinventing decisions constantly |

Design against these from day one.

## Closing reflection

> A scalable team doesn't just ship code faster.  
> It scales its ability to reason — even under pressure, turnover, and change.

Building reasoning architectures isn’t overhead — it’s the **only way** to make smart engineering sustainable.
