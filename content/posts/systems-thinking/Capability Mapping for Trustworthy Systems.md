title: 'Capability mapping for trustworthy systems'
---

You can’t engineer trust with wishful thinking.  
You need **capabilities** -- real, observable, improvable abilities.

Trustworthiness emerges when system capabilities are intentional, mapped, and grown.

Capability mapping turns "we hope this works" into "we know how and where trust is built."

---

## What is a capability?

A **capability** is not a technology, a feature, or a deliverable.  
It’s a **repeatable ability** to perform a critical action under expected and unexpected conditions.

| Element | Definition |
|:--------|:-----------|
| Input | Conditions under which capability must act |
| Process | How capability operates |
| Output | Observable, verifiable result |

---

## Why map capabilities?

- **Reveal gaps** in systemic trustworthiness
- **Align** engineering and organizational investment
- **Prioritize** real growth over surface metrics
- **Manage drift** from intended resilience targets

> You can't improve what you can't see.

## Steps for capability mapping

### 1. Identify trust anchors

What are the critical aspects where trust must not be broken?  (e.g., data integrity, recovery speed, cross-team alignment)

### 2. Define critical capabilities

What abilities enable trust in those anchors? (e.g., **Automated Recovery**, **Early Drift Detection**, **Trustworthy Handoff Processes**)

### 3. Assess current capability maturity

- Use observable evidence, not self-reporting.
- Document gaps, fragilities, and assumptions.

### 4. Build capability development plans

- Treat capabilities like evolving products.
- Prioritize capabilities whose absence poses systemic risks.

## Trustworthy capability example

| Capability | Description | Key Metric |
|:-----------|:-------------|:-----------|
| Automated Recovery | Ability to restore service without manual intervention after a known failure type | Mean Time to Autonomous Recovery (MTAR) |

---

## Capability evolution is continuous

Capability mapping is **not static**.  
As the system evolves, so must its capabilities:

- **New assumptions emerge** → new capabilities needed.
- **Old fragilities harden** → old capabilities must evolve.

> Resilience is not a checklist. It's a living portfolio.

---

## Example capability health metrics

| Metric | What It Measures |
|:-------|:-----------------|
| Capability Drift Rate | Deviation from intended ability over time |
| Capability Fragility Index | How often capability fails under real conditions |
| Capability Development Velocity | Time from gap identification to capability improvement |

## Reasoning trail

**Origin:**  
Derived from systems thinking, organizational capability models, resilience engineering, and critical systems design.

(Connected to: *Trustworthy System Foundations*, *Organizational Trust Feedback Loops*, *Architectural Integrity Manifesto*.)

**Trigger context:**  
- Post-incident analysis showing failure of *expected* capabilities
- Strategic planning requiring trust improvement beyond surface reliability
- Engineering retrospectives surfacing drifted or implicit capabilities

> **Core insight:**  You don't engineer systems. You engineer the capabilities that let systems stay trustworthy.

**Related artifacts:**  
- `Systemic Trustworthiness Dashboards`

**Likely evolution:**  
- Embedding capability reviews into architecture reviews
- Explicit capability maps linked to system design documents

Trust isn’t an output.  
It’s an emergent property of **what your system can actually do when it matters**.
