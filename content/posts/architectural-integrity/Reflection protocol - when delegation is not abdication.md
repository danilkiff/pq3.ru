## Purpose

To help engineering leaders, architects, and R&D leads distinguish between **strategic delegation** and **cognitive abdication** — especially when using AI or expert systems as thinking partners.

---

## The core principle

> Delegation becomes abdication only when decisions are outsourced **without understanding**.
> Responsible leadership requires retaining the final accountability **even if reasoning is shared.**

## Checklist: are you delegating strategically?

| Signal                                    | Interpretation                                 |
|-------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| You define the context before asking      | You're owning the frame                     |
| You compare answers to your hypotheses    | You're thinking, not offloading             |
| You request structure, not prescription   | You're seeking support, not authority       |
| You revise and question generated outputs | You're iterating, not blindly consuming     |
| You document decisions explicitly         | You're signaling ownership                  |

## Signs of cognitive refusal

- "Just tell me what to do"
- No effort to translate answers into your domain
- Avoiding decisions due to fear of accountability
- Overusing delegation to escape complexity
- Blind trust in tools, platforms, or agents

---

## Reflection prompts (use in 1:1 or self-review)

- What decision am I trying to make?
- What constraints or risks have I already identified?
- Am I delegating because I'm overloaded — or avoiding responsibility?
- Do I understand the logic behind the recommendation?
- If this goes wrong, **can I explain why I went this way?**

## Example scenario -- working with AI assistants

**Not abdication:**  
-- "Help me analyze this architecture for resilience trade-offs. I want to test my assumptions."

**Is abdication:**  
-- "Write the architecture for me. I don't have time to think about it."

The goal is not to avoid thinking — it's to **unload memory** so you can work on **system-level cognition.**
This is delegation **as augmentation**, not escape.
