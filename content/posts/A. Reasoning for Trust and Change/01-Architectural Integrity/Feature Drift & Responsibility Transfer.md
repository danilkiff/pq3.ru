title: 'Feature Drift & Responsibility Transfer'
---

# 

You planned a feature. You scoped it. You reviewed it.  
Two months later, the feature is still shipping — but what’s being built no longer resembles the original intent.

You’re facing **feature drift**.  
Worse, you’re blamed for the outcome — even though you never owned the decision.

---

## 🧠 What is Feature Drift?

Feature drift occurs when:

- **The implementation diverges** from the original intent  
- **No one notices** until delivery or postmortem  
- **Responsibility is transferred retroactively** to someone who wasn’t in the loop

This is not just a process flaw. It’s a **cultural indicator** that strategic alignment is broken.

---

## 🔁 Typical Pattern

1. **Backlog item added** by product or leadership — often under-specified
2. **Analyst fills in the blanks**, sometimes missing deeper context
3. **Engineering implements "what’s written"**, even when signals suggest misalignment
4. **Result disappoints**, root cause is traced *backward*, often unfairly

> This creates the illusion of continuous delivery — while actual product value regresses.

---

## 🧱 Structural Causes

- Misuse of backlog as a **todo list** instead of a hypothesis funnel
- Lack of **definition of alignment** or review checkpoints
- **Separation of role and responsibility** (e.g., architect accountable but not consulted)
- Absence of **status traceability** from idea → alignment → analysis → estimate

---

## 🚨 Cultural Red Flags

- “Just follow the spec” mindset  
- Stakeholders skipping grooming and relying on documentation alone  
- Engineering penalized for implementing the written word, not the intended outcome  
- **Retrospective justification**: “You should have spoken up sooner”

---

## 🔒 How to Prevent It

1. **Formalize alignment as a status**
   - Status = `In Alignment`, with explicit Definition of Done

2. **Link change requests to origin and risk**
   - Tie tech debt to its originating decision. Make drift visible.

3. **Create dual traceability**
   - From strategic objective → feature  
   - From implementation → owner of intent

4. **Refuse decoupled accountability**
   - No one is “responsible” without decision-making input

## 🧭 Reasoning Trail

**Origin:**  
Synthesized from real-world product and architecture conflicts in which engineers executed tasks that diverged from initial vision (see: *CTO Thinking Paradox*, *Architectural Integrity Manifesto*).

**Trigger context:**  
- Architect asked to explain delays caused by last-minute feature redirection  
- Team shipped work based on spec, then blamed when value was unclear  
- No shared understanding of what “done” meant across roles

**Core insight:**  
→ *Feature drift happens when alignment is shallow and responsibility is late.*

- `Thinking Rituals for Incident Coordination`  
- `Capability Map: Feature Delivery System`

**Likely evolution:**  
- This will be extended into `Ticket Status Design for Alignment Tracking`  
- Influences future models of `Strategic Feedback Compression`

You can’t own outcomes if you never owned the upstream choices.  
And you shouldn’t be asked to.
